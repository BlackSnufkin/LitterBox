## Overview

LitterBox provides a controlled sandbox environment designed for security professionals to develop and test malware payloads. This platform allows red teams to:

* Test evasion techniques against modern detection techniques
* Validate detection signatures before field deployment
* Analyze malware behavior in an isolated environment
* Keep payloads in-house without exposing them to external security vendors
* Ensure payload functionality without triggering production security controls

The platform includes LLM-assisted analysis capabilities through the LitterBoxMCP server, offering advanced analytical insights using natural language processing technology.

**Note**: While designed primarily for red teams, LitterBox can be equally valuable for blue teams by shifting perspective â€“ using the same tools in their malware analysis workflows.
